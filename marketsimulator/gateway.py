class Gateway:
    """ Creates an empty Python Matching Engine (orderbook simulator) and injects 
    real historical orders to it creating the real orderbooks and trades
    that happened in that orderbook session. It also allows you to send
    your own orders to make them interact (i.e. cross) with the historical
    orderbooks that were present that day. The orders you send to the orderbook 
    through this Gateway will also experience latency as they 
    would in real life.
    
    The Gateway allows us to run a synchronous simulation of the interaction
    of your algorithm with a Python Matching Engine (orderbook simulator)
    that will be injected with real life historical orders of a 
    past orderbook session while taking into account the effect
    of this latency. 
    
    For example, when your algorithm receives a new orderbook best bid price,
    actually this price happened "md_latency" microseconds in the past, 
    the time it took to reach your algorithm. Your algo will take "algo_latency"
    microseconds to make a decission and send a message (new/cancel/modif),
    and finally, this message will take "ob_latency" microseconds to reach
    the orderbook because of the physical distance and the different systems
    it needs to cross through before reaching the orderbook. 
    
    The total latency will be: 
        latency = md_latency + algo_latency + ob_latency
    
    When you send messages to a orderbook through this Gateway, 
    your messages will reach the orderbook "latency" microseconds 
    after the time of the last historical order that reached the orderbook
    and that produced the last orderbook data update upon which your
    algo made its last decission.
